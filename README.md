## ECS289C Spring2025 - Compilers and Program Analysis 

This course will cover compilers, program analyis techniques, and their applications. Some of the topics covered in this course include control and data flow analysis, 
pointer analysis, symbolic executing, fuzzing and testing, just-in-time compilation, decompilation and binary lifting, and compiler-based software security defenses.

### Prerequisites

This course has no formal prerequisite, but previous experience with compiler design would be helpful.

### Schedule

The course schedule can be found [here](Schedule.md). 

### Grading

This course will have two main components - paper presentations and final projects, each worth 40% of the grade. 
Additionally, we will discuss the paper online (TBD) and also in class, after the presentation. 20% of points will be for paper discussions.
We will also have an optional 5% extra-credit homework at the start of the quarter.

Paper presentations will be
performed individually. Each student will be expected to present and lead the discussion for 2-3 papers during the quarter.
The slides for each presentation should be submitted to the instructor 3 days before the presentation day for feedback. 

Final projects will be performed in groups of two. A few project ideas are provided [here](Projects.md), and students 
are welcome to propose their own projects.

The midterm and final will be in-class and closed book. The assignments will be performed in groups of 2.

The grade cutoffs will be as follows.

## Policies

### Using AI
Using AI tools to help with coding is permitted, but from my experience using these tools without knowing what you are doing causes infinitely more problems than just learning and implementing it yourself. The projects assigned are research projects which are by 
definition unsolved problems. So, I expect LLMs to be minimally useful in solving them. 

Using AI for generating content for the presentation slides is **not** permitted. I don't recommend it, but you _can_ use AI to help you understand the paper. But again, beware, AI tools are pretty bad at understanding the program analysis papers and hallucinate **a lot!!** 

That said, you are responsible for 100% of what you turn in. Turning in submissions that you cannot fully explain and justify in person will result in a zero for that component and potentially, being reported to SJA for academic dishonesty. 

### Collaboration

You are welcome to collaborate and discuss your projects and presentations with others in the class. Discussing and accepting help from others from outside of the class is, by default, not permitted. Please talk with me if, for some reason, you feel you want do this. We will evaluate it on a case-by-case basis.

### Attendance and participation

In general, the student can miss no more than 3 classes, without providing a valid reason. However, attendance alone is not enough to secure the participation grade component. You must contribute to the discussions to get the participation points.

Missing class on the day of their presentation will get a zero for that presentation. In rare cases, we will be able to accommodate the presentation on a later day, but this isn't guaranteed.

## Student support

UC Davis is dedicated to supporting the mental health and well-being of all students. 
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or in need of assistance, confidential mental health services are available through [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).
Please also feel free to contact me by scheduling separate office hours if you would like to discuss any such factors affecting your class performance. Additional accommodations might also be available to address these factors.
