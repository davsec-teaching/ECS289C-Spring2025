## ECS289C Spring2025 - Compilers and Programming Languages

This course will cover compilers and program analyis techniques, broadly defined. Some of the topics covered in this course include control and data flow analysis, 
pointer analysis, symbolic executing, fuzzing and testing, just-in-time compilation, decompilation and binary lifting, and compiler-based software security defenses.

### Prerequisites

This course has no formal prerequisite, but previous experience with compiler design would be helpful.

### Basic information

### Schedule

The course schedule can be found [here](Schedule.md). 

### Grading

This course will have two main components - paper presentations and final projects, each worth 40% of the grade. 
Additionally, we will discuss the paper online (TBD) and also in class, after the presentation. 20% of points will be for paper discussions.
We will also have an optional 5% extra-credit homework at the start of the quarter.

Paper presentations will be
performed individually. Each student will be expected to present and lead the discussion for 2-3 papers during the quarter.
The slides for each presentation should be submitted to the instructor 3 days before the presentation day for feedback. 

Final projects will be performed in groups of two. A few project ideas are provided [here](Projects.md), and students 
are welcome to propose their own projects.

There will be an optional 5% extra-credit homework at the start of the quarter to help students get familiar with the LLVM compiler toolchain.

There are no required textbooks. Please check [here](Resources.md) for recommended textbooks and resources.

## Policies

### Using AI
Using AI ([ChatGPT](chatgpt.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)) to help with coding is permitted, but from my experience using these tools without knowing what you are doing causes more problems. Moreover, the projects assigned are research projects which are by 
definition unsolved problems. So, I expect LLMs to be minimally useful in actually solving the problem. 

Using AI for creating presentation slides is **not** permitted. You can however use AI to help you understand the paper. But again, beware, AI tools are pretty bad at understanding the program analysis papers and hallucinate **a lot!!** 

The student is responsible for all code/presentation/report they turn in. Turning in submissions that they cannot explain and justify will result in a zero for that component and potentially, being reported to SJA. 

### Collaboration

You are welcome to collaborate and discuss your projects and presentations with others in the class. Discussing and getting help from others from outside of the class is, by default, not permitted. Please talk with me if, for some reason, you feel you must do this.

### Attendance and participation

In general, the student can miss no more than 3 classes, without providing a valid reason. However, attendance alone is not enough to secure the participation grade component. 

## Student support

UC Davis is dedicated to supporting the mental health and well-being of all students. 
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or in need of assistance, confidential mental health services are available through [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).
Please also feel free to contact me by scheduling separate office hours if you would like to discuss any such factors affecting your class performance. Additional accommodations might also be available to address these factors.
